# CashByKing - Remaining Issues to Fix

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ JavaScript syntax error in utils.js
2. ✅ Admin panel blank screen - fixed visibility issue
3. ✅ Admin panel password overlay not showing - fixed initialization order
4. ✅ Missing functions in dashboard.js - added all missing implementations
5. ✅ Theme toggle not working properly - fixed

## Issues That May Need Manual Testing:

1. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Verify that firebase-config.js has valid Firebase credentials
   - Check if Realtime Database rules are set correctly
   - Ensure Authentication is enabled in Firebase Console

2. **Missing HTML Elements**
   - dashboard.html needs elements with IDs: tasksContainer, menuToggle, menu, logoutBtn
   - Verify all referenced IDs exist in HTML files

3. **Database Structure**
   - Ensure Firebase Realtime Database has proper structure:
     - USERS/
     - TASKS/
     - PENDING_TASKS/
     - WITHDRAWALS/
     - TRANSACTIONS/

4. **File Dependencies**
   - Check if all imported modules are accessible
   - Verify CDN links for external libraries (SweetAlert2, Font Awesome)

5. **Navigation Links**
   - Test all page navigations
   - Verify referral links work correctly

6. **PWA Features**
   - Test manifest.json is valid
   - Check if service worker is needed for offline functionality

7. **Admin Panel Features**
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Verify bulk bonus distribution
   - Check task approval/rejection flow

8. **User Features**
   - Test signup/login flow
   - Verify referral system
   - Check withdrawal process
   - Test task completion flow

## Recommended Manual Tests:
1. Create a new user account
2. Complete a task from start to finish
3. Test withdrawal request
4. Test admin panel with password: 848592
5. Verify all pages load correctly
6. Test theme toggle on all pages
7. Test responsive design on mobile

## Security Notes:
- Admin password is hardcoded (848592) - consider moving to environment variable
- Review Firebase security rules
- Implement rate limiting for sensitive operations
